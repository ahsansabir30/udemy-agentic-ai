      "### Current Situation Analysis\n",
      "Tomorrow in San Francisco, the weather is expected to be sunny with good solar irradiance, especially in the afternoon. The electricity pricing follows a time-of-use model, with lower rates during off-peak hours (late night and early morning) and higher rates during peak hours (midday to early evening).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommended Actions\n",
      "1. **Charge During Off-Peak Hours**: \n",
      "   - **Best Time**: Start charging your electric car between **10 PM and 6 AM** when electricity rates are at their lowest (around $0.11 to $0.13 per kWh).\n",
      "   - **Alternative Time**: If you prefer to charge during the day, consider charging from **10 PM to 12 AM** and then again from **10 PM to 12 AM** the next night, as rates are lower during these hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Maximize Solar Power Utilization**:\n",
      "   - If you have a solar power system, consider charging your car during the peak solar generation hours, which will be from **11 AM to 3 PM**. However, note that the rates during this time are higher (around $0.18 to $0.22 per kWh).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Monitor Solar Generation**: \n",
      "   - If you can, check your solar generation data in real-time to see when your system is producing the most energy, and align your charging accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Expected Benefits\n",
      "- **Cost Savings**: Charging during off-peak hours can save you approximately **$0.05 to $0.10 per kWh** compared to peak hours. If you charge 30 kWh, this could mean savings of **$1.50 to $3.00**.\n",
      "- **Environmental Impact**: By charging during solar peak hours, you can reduce reliance on grid electricity, which may come from fossil fuels, thus lowering your carbon footprint.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Implementation Tips\n",
      "- **Set a Timer**: Use a programmable timer or smart charging station to automate the charging schedule during off-peak hours.\n",
      "- **Check Solar Output**: If you have a solar monitoring app, use it to track real-time solar output and adjust your charging time if necessary.\n",
      "- **Plan for Full Charge**: Ensure your car is fully charged by the time you need it, especially if you are charging during off-peak hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these recommendations, you can effectively minimize your charging costs while maximizing the use of solar energy.\n"

       "    AIMessage(content='### Current Situation Analysis\\nTomorrow, October 7, 2023, in San Francisco, the weather is expected to be partly cloudy with varying solar irradiance throughout the day. The electricity pricing follows a time-of-use model, with off-peak rates during the night and early morning, and peak rates during the day.\\n\\n### Recommended Actions\\n1. **Charge During Off-Peak Hours**: \\n   - **Best Time**: Charge your electric car between **12:00 AM and 6:00 AM** when the rates are lower (ranging from $0.111 to $0.132 per kWh).\\n   - **Alternative Time**: If you miss the early hours, consider charging after **10:00 PM** when the rate drops to **$0.106 per kWh**.\\n\\n2. **Maximize Solar Power Utilization**:\\n   - If you have a solar power system, consider charging your car during the **afternoon hours (1 PM to 4 PM)** when solar generation is higher, especially around **1 PM** (solar irradiance of 736.3 W/m²) and **2 PM** (674.1 W/m²). However, note that the electricity rates during this time are higher (around $0.222 to $0.220 per kWh).\\n\\n3. **Monitor Solar Generation**: \\n   - If you can, check your solar generation data in real-time to align your charging with peak solar output.\\n\\n### Expected Benefits\\n- **Cost Savings**: Charging during off-peak hours can save you approximately **$0.10 to $0.20 per kWh** compared to peak hours. For example, if you charge 30 kWh, you could save around **$3.00 to $6.00**.\\n- **Environmental Impact**: By charging during peak solar generation hours, you reduce reliance on grid electricity, which may come from fossil fuels, thus lowering your carbon footprint.\\n\\n### Implementation Tips\\n- **Set a Timer**: Use a programmable timer or smart charging station to ensure your car charges during the recommended hours.\\n- **Check Solar Output**: If you have a solar monitoring app, use it to track real-time solar output to optimize your charging time.\\n- **Plan for Full Charge**: Ensure your car is plugged in before the off-peak hours start to take full advantage of the lower rates.\\n\\nBy following these recommendations, you can effectively minimize your charging costs while maximizing the use of solar energy.', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 511, 'prompt_tokens': 3545, 'total_tokens': 4056, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_3683ee3deb', 'id': 'chatcmpl-CsnCUyop7Obb6UBTfsXINwRaS4PiK', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='energy_advisor', id='lc_run--019b73d4-a48e-7bd2-b4f7-d02b46d4d85b-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 3545, 'output_tokens': 511, 'total_tokens': 4056, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})]},\n",

       "    AIMessage(content='### Current Situation Analysis\\nThis weekend in San Francisco, the weather is expected to be mostly sunny, which is ideal for maximizing solar power usage. The solar irradiance levels will vary throughout the day, with peak production likely occurring during midday hours. Additionally, electricity prices will fluctuate based on peak and off-peak periods, which can influence your energy consumption strategy.\\n\\n### Recommended Actions\\n1. **Optimize Solar Usage Timing**:\\n   - **Peak Solar Hours**: Focus on using solar power between **10 AM and 4 PM** when solar irradiance is highest (up to 920.9 W/m²).\\n   - **Energy-Intensive Tasks**: Schedule high-energy tasks (like running the dishwasher or laundry) during these hours to utilize solar energy directly.\\n\\n2. **Battery Storage**:\\n   - If you have a solar battery, charge it during peak solar hours to store excess energy for use in the evening when solar production drops.\\n\\n3. **Monitor Weather Conditions**:\\n   - Keep an eye on the hourly weather forecast to adjust your energy usage based on real-time solar production.\\n\\n4. **Reduce Energy Consumption During Peak Pricing**:\\n   - Avoid using high-energy appliances during peak electricity pricing hours (typically from **4 PM to 9 PM**). Instead, use stored solar energy or reduce usage during these times.\\n\\n5. **Adjust Thermostat Settings**:\\n   - If you have a smart thermostat, consider setting it to a higher temperature during the day when solar energy is abundant and cooling needs are lower.\\n\\n### Expected Benefits\\n- **Cost Savings**: By using solar energy during peak hours and avoiding peak electricity rates, you could save approximately **15-20%** on your electricity bill for the weekend.\\n- **Energy Savings**: Utilizing solar power can significantly reduce your reliance on grid electricity, potentially saving you **5-10 kWh** over the weekend.\\n- **Carbon Footprint Reduction**: By maximizing solar usage, you contribute to a lower carbon footprint, reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with grid electricity.\\n\\n### Implementation Tips\\n- **Set Reminders**: Use your smartphone or smart home devices to set reminders for when to run appliances.\\n- **Check Solar Production**: If possible, monitor your solar production through your inverter or a solar monitoring app to ensure you are maximizing usage.\\n- **Plan Ahead**: Prepare meals or laundry loads in advance to align with peak solar hours.\\n\\nBy following these recommendations, you can effectively maximize your solar power usage this weekend, leading to both financial savings and environmental benefits.', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 513, 'prompt_tokens': 3526, 'total_tokens': 4039, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 2688}}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_3683ee3deb', 'id': 'chatcmpl-CsnD2JmKMmukKtnOYrQuNCBBOaWPZ', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='energy_advisor', id='lc_run--019b73d5-289f-7592-a79c-f97ed5fa7f06-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 3526, 'output_tokens': 513, 'total_tokens': 4039, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 2688}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})]},\n",

       "    AIMessage(content='### Current Situation Analysis\\nIn San Francisco, electricity prices vary significantly between day and night due to time-of-use pricing. Charging your electric vehicle (EV) during off-peak hours (typically at night) is generally more cost-effective than during peak hours (daytime).\\n\\n### Recommended Actions\\n1. **Charge During Off-Peak Hours**: \\n   - **Best Times**: From 12 AM to 6 AM, the rates are lower, with the cheapest rate at 1 AM ($0.109 per kWh).\\n   - **Avoid Peak Hours**: Peak hours (6 AM to 10 PM) have higher rates, with the most expensive being around 7 AM to 8 PM (up to $0.225 per kWh).\\n\\n2. **Monitor Charging Schedule**: \\n   - Set your EV to charge automatically during the night to take advantage of the lower rates.\\n\\n3. **Consider Solar Power**: \\n   - If you have solar panels, charge your EV during the day when solar generation is high (around noon) to maximize the use of your own renewable energy.\\n\\n### Expected Benefits\\n- **Cost Savings**: Charging at night can save you approximately $0.10 to $0.12 per kWh compared to peak hours. For example, if you charge 30 kWh, you could save around $3 to $3.60 per charge.\\n- **Environmental Impact**: Charging during off-peak hours can help reduce strain on the grid and lower carbon emissions associated with electricity generation.\\n\\n### Implementation Tips\\n- **Use Smart Charging**: If your EV supports it, use smart charging features to schedule charging during the cheapest times automatically.\\n- **Track Your Usage**: Keep an eye on your electricity bill to see the savings from charging at night versus during the day.\\n- **Be Aware of Demand Charges**: If your utility has demand charges, charging during off-peak hours can help avoid these additional costs.\\n\\nBy following these recommendations, you can optimize your EV charging strategy, save money, and contribute to a more sustainable energy system.', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 424, 'prompt_tokens': 3529, 'total_tokens': 3953, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 1408}}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_29330a9688', 'id': 'chatcmpl-CsnDahT7fVPTaVqpGfAR6L2vbWRVi', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, name='energy_advisor', id='lc_run--019b73d5-ad3c-70d0-b606-94f823596675-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 3529, 'output_tokens': 424, 'total_tokens': 3953, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 1408}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})]},\n",

However, I can provide general insights into how much you can save by using energy-efficient appliances based on typical usage patterns.\\n\\n### Recommended Actions\\n1. **Upgrade to ENERGY STAR Appliances**: When replacing old appliances, choose ENERGY STAR certified products, which can use 10-50% less energy than standard models.\\n2. **Optimize Usage**: \\n   - **Washing Machine**: Wash clothes in cold water and only run full loads. This can save about $40 per year.\\n   - **Dishwasher**: Run it only when full and use the eco mode. This can save around $25 annually.\\n   - **Refrigerator**: Keep it at the optimal temperature (37°F for fresh food and 0°F for the freezer) to maximize efficiency.\\n3. **Smart Thermostats**: Install a smart thermostat to save up to 10% on heating and cooling costs by adjusting temperatures when you're away.\\n4. **Seal Air Leaks**: Use weatherstripping and caulk to seal leaks around windows and doors, which can save up to 20% on heating and cooling costs.\\n\\n### Expected Benefits\\n- **Cost Savings**: By implementing these changes, you could save anywhere from $100 to $300 annually, depending on your current appliance usage and energy rates.\\n- **Energy Savings**: Upgrading to energy-efficient appliances can reduce your energy consumption significantly, contributing to a lower carbon footprint.\\n- **Comfort**: Improved appliance efficiency often leads to better performance and comfort in your home.\\n\\n### Implementation Tips\\n- **Research and Compare**: When shopping for new appliances, compare the energy ratings and estimated annual operating costs.\\n- **Monitor Usage**: Keep track of your energy bills before and after making changes to see the impact of your new appliances.\\n- **Consider Rebates**: Check for local or federal rebates for purchasing energy-efficient appliances, which can offset initial costs.\\n\\nBy making these changes, you can not only save money but also contribute to a more sustainable environment.

      "Message: ### Current Situation Analysis\n",
      "Tomorrow, October 7, 2023, in San Francisco, the weather is expected to be partly cloudy with varying solar irradiance throughout the day. The electricity pricing follows a time-of-use model, with off-peak rates during the night and early morning, and peak rates during the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommended Actions\n",
      "1. **Charge During Off-Peak Hours**: \n",
      "   - **Best Time**: Charge your electric car between **12:00 AM and 6:00 AM** when the rates are lower (ranging from $0.111 to $0.132 per kWh).\n",
      "   - **Alternative Time**: If you miss the early hours, consider charging after **10:00 PM** when the rate drops to **$0.106 per kWh**.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Maximize Solar Power Utilization**:\n",
      "   - If you have a solar power system, consider charging your car during the **afternoon hours (1 PM to 4 PM)** when solar generation is higher, especially around **1 PM** (solar irradiance of 736.3 W/m²) and **2 PM** (674.1 W/m²). However, note that the electricity rates during this time are higher (around $0.222 to $0.220 per kWh).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Monitor Solar Generation**: \n",
      "   - If you can, check your solar generation data in real-time to align your charging with peak solar output.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Expected Benefits\n",
      "- **Cost Savings**: Charging during off-peak hours can save you approximately **$0.10 to $0.20 per kWh** compared to peak hours. For example, if you charge 30 kWh, you could save around **$3.00 to $6.00**.\n",
      "- **Environmental Impact**: By charging during peak solar generation hours, you reduce reliance on grid electricity, which may come from fossil fuels, thus lowering your carbon footprint.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Implementation Tips\n",
      "- **Set a Timer**: Use a programmable timer or smart charging station to ensure your car charges during the recommended hours.\n",
      "- **Check Solar Output**: If you have a solar monitoring app, use it to track real-time solar output to optimize your charging time.\n",
      "- **Plan for Full Charge**: Ensure your car is plugged in before the off-peak hours start to take full advantage of the lower rates.\n",
      "\n",

      "Message: ### Current Situation Analysis\n",
      "This weekend in San Francisco, the weather is expected to be mostly sunny, which is ideal for maximizing solar power usage. The solar irradiance levels will vary throughout the day, with peak production likely occurring during midday hours. Additionally, electricity prices will fluctuate based on peak and off-peak periods, which can influence your energy consumption strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommended Actions\n",
      "1. **Optimize Solar Usage Timing**:\n",
      "   - **Peak Solar Hours**: Focus on using solar power between **10 AM and 4 PM** when solar irradiance is highest (up to 920.9 W/m²).\n",
      "   - **Energy-Intensive Tasks**: Schedule high-energy tasks (like running the dishwasher or laundry) during these hours to utilize solar energy directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Battery Storage**:\n",
      "   - If you have a solar battery, charge it during peak solar hours to store excess energy for use in the evening when solar production drops.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Monitor Weather Conditions**:\n",
      "   - Keep an eye on the hourly weather forecast to adjust your energy usage based on real-time solar production.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Reduce Energy Consumption During Peak Pricing**:\n",
      "   - Avoid using high-energy appliances during peak electricity pricing hours (typically from **4 PM to 9 PM**). Instead, use stored solar energy or reduce usage during these times.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Adjust Thermostat Settings**:\n",
      "   - If you have a smart thermostat, consider setting it to a higher temperature during the day when solar energy is abundant and cooling needs are lower.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Expected Benefits\n",
      "- **Cost Savings**: By using solar energy during peak hours and avoiding peak electricity rates, you could save approximately **15-20%** on your electricity bill for the weekend.\n",
      "- **Energy Savings**: Utilizing solar power can significantly reduce your reliance on grid electricity, potentially saving you **5-10 kWh** over the weekend.\n",
      "- **Carbon Footprint Reduction**: By maximizing solar usage, you contribute to a lower carbon footprint, reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with grid electricity.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Implementation Tips\n",
      "- **Set Reminders**: Use your smartphone or smart home devices to set reminders for when to run appliances.\n",
      "- **Check Solar Production**: If possible, monitor your solar production through your inverter or a solar monitoring app to ensure you are maximizing usage.\n",
      "- **Plan Ahead**: Prepare meals or laundry loads in advance to align with peak solar hours.\n",

      "Message: ### Current Situation Analysis\n",
      "In San Francisco, electricity prices vary significantly between day and night due to time-of-use pricing. Charging your electric vehicle (EV) during off-peak hours (typically at night) is generally more cost-effective than during peak hours (daytime).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommended Actions\n",
      "1. **Charge During Off-Peak Hours**: \n",
      "   - **Best Times**: From 12 AM to 6 AM, the rates are lower, with the cheapest rate at 1 AM ($0.109 per kWh).\n",
      "   - **Avoid Peak Hours**: Peak hours (6 AM to 10 PM) have higher rates, with the most expensive being around 7 AM to 8 PM (up to $0.225 per kWh).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Monitor Charging Schedule**: \n",
      "   - Set your EV to charge automatically during the night to take advantage of the lower rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Consider Solar Power**: \n",
      "   - If you have solar panels, charge your EV during the day when solar generation is high (around noon) to maximize the use of your own renewable energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Expected Benefits\n",
      "- **Cost Savings**: Charging at night can save you approximately $0.10 to $0.12 per kWh compared to peak hours. For example, if you charge 30 kWh, you could save around $3 to $3.60 per charge.\n",
      "- **Environmental Impact**: Charging during off-peak hours can help reduce strain on the grid and lower carbon emissions associated with electricity generation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Implementation Tips\n",
      "- **Use Smart Charging**: If your EV supports it, use smart charging features to schedule charging during the cheapest times automatically.\n",
      "- **Track Your Usage**: Keep an eye on your electricity bill to see the savings from charging at night versus during the day.\n",
      "- **Be Aware of Demand Charges**: If your utility has demand charges, charging during off-peak hours can help avoid these additional costs.\n",

      "To determine the best time to run your washing machine in San Francisco, we need to consider the current electricity pricing and the forecasted weather conditions. The electricity prices vary throughout the day, with off-peak hours generally being cheaper than peak hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommended Actions\n",
      "1. **Run During Off-Peak Hours**: \n",
      "   - The best time to run your washing machine is during off-peak hours, which are typically from 12 AM to 6 AM. \n",
      "   - Specifically, the lowest rates are between 2 AM (0.114 USD/kWh) and 3 AM (0.131 USD/kWh).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Avoid Peak Hours**: \n",

      "- **Cost Savings**: By running your washing machine during off-peak hours, you could save approximately 20-30% on your electricity bill compared to peak hours.\n",
      "- **Environmental Impact**: Using off-peak electricity can help reduce strain on the grid and lower carbon emissions associated with energy production.\n",
      "- **Comfort**: Running the machine at night can also help keep your home cooler during the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Implementation Tips\n",
      "- **Set a Timer**: If your washing machine has a delay start feature, set it to start during the recommended off-peak hours.\n",
      "- **Monitor Usage**: Keep track of your electricity bill to see the impact of running your washing machine during these times.\n",

      "To determine the best time to run your washing machine in San Francisco, we need to consider the current electricity pricing and the forecasted weather conditions. The electricity prices vary throughout the day, with off-peak hours generally being cheaper than peak hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommended Actions\n",
      "1. **Run During Off-Peak Hours**: \n",
      "   - The best time to run your washing machine is during off-peak hours, which are typically from 12 AM to 6 AM. \n",
      "   - Specifically, the lowest rates are between 2 AM (0.114 USD/kWh) and 3 AM (0.131 USD/kWh).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Avoid Peak Hours**: \n",
      "   - Avoid running your washing machine between 6 AM and 10 PM when electricity rates are higher (up to 0.224 USD/kWh).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Consider Weather Conditions**: \n",
      "   - If you have a solar power system, running your washing machine during sunny hours (around 10 AM to 4 PM) can help utilize solar energy, especially if you have a net metering system.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Expected Benefits\n",
      "- **Cost Savings**: By running your washing machine during off-peak hours, you could save approximately 20-30% on your electricity bill compared to peak hours.\n",
      "- **Environmental Impact**: Using off-peak electricity can help reduce strain on the grid and lower carbon emissions associated with energy production.\n",
      "- **Comfort**: Running the machine at night can also help keep your home cooler during the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Implementation Tips\n",
      "- **Set a Timer**: If your washing machine has a delay start feature, set it to start during the recommended off-peak hours.\n",
      "- **Monitor Usage**: Keep track of your electricity bill to see the impact of running your washing machine during these times.\n",
      "- **Adjust for Weather**: If it's a sunny day and you have solar panels, consider running the machine during the day to maximize solar energy use.\n",
